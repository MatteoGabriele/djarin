# Djarin

A CLI tool for creating React projects with ease.

### Why
I built this CLI tool to streamline setting up new React projects. Instead of using create-vite, dealing with unnecessary boilerplate, and manually adding Tailwind and React Router, this tool does it all in one go. It saves time and keeps the setup process consistent and efficient for my use case.

### Install

```bash
npm install -g djarin
```

### Usage

Simply run

```bash
djarin
```
